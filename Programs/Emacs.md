Emacs, essentially, is a text editor. But, not only that. Emacs is extremely configurable, and also plastic, 
with matchs perfectly with the system idea. I have experience using nano, but as a inicial programmer and 
also a system "tester", i like to experiment new things. The ideia of using a text editor as, of course, a 
text editor, but also using as a compiler for languages, latex, while configuring the layout, really catch me.
So with the help of two friends, and some chifre, wy not ?
