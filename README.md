Actually, i use KDE DE (how to install in the install file), with linux standard newer kernel available. I don't use zsh, or other bash things. For installing, i use pacman and yay, pretty good ones, i recommend. To the pacman, some tips: 

- Update your mirrors from time to time (monthy or somethig like this) There are many ways to do so, the most common are [reflector](https://ostechnix.com/retrieve-latest-mirror-list-using-reflector-arch-linux/), or with the full mirrorlist (to get, go to [this site](https://archlinux.org/mirrorlist/), you put that in the /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist file, and the package rankmirrors will rank by speed (to know how to [use](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxbrasil/comments/9esc3s/usando_reflector_e_rankmirrors_no_arch_linux/))
- If you want colors, just edit in the /etc/pacman.conf file, and unmark the colors option
- If you want more cool stuff, digit under colors "ILoveCandy"
- If you have good internet, in the same pacman.conf file as above, uncomment ParallelDownloads
- With downgrade package, you can actually manage the version of them. 
- From time to time, clear your cache from pacman.
