# The Experience (2023)
Actually, i use KDE DE (how to install in the install file), with linux standard newer kernel available. I don't use zsh, or other bash things. For installing, i use pacman and yay, pretty good ones, i recommend. To the pacman, some tips: 

- Update your mirrors from time to time (monthy or somethig like this) There are many ways to do so, the most common are [reflector](https://ostechnix.com/retrieve-latest-mirror-list-using-reflector-arch-linux/), or with the full mirrorlist (to get, go to [this site](https://archlinux.org/mirrorlist/), you put that in the /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist file, and the package rankmirrors will rank by speed (to know how to [use](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxbrasil/comments/9esc3s/usando_reflector_e_rankmirrors_no_arch_linux/))
- If you want colors, just edit in the /etc/pacman.conf file, and unmark the colors option
- If you want more cool stuff, digit under colors "ILoveCandy"
- If you have good internet, in the same pacman.conf file as above, uncomment ParallelDownloads
- With downgrade package, you can actually manage the version of them. 
- From time to time, clear your cache from pacman. 

For programs usability, my experience is: If you want and have the time, you can do whatever you want. For undergraduates and Linux TI entusiasts, it's a good mid point. Becauuse you can do muuch things, but some details can fall from your grasp. By exameple, programs like MatLab, AutoCad and others alike are hard to find here, and in the end, Windows will do the ob. I'm a dual booter (don't even know if this term exists lol), and it's necessary for my usage. Games, the type of programs i mencioned before, and some other tricky things is just better in Windows. At least for now. Most are licensed programs, the ones that give you that big headache.
